    <h1>A short summary of my life so far.</h1>
    <div class="life-story">
      <p>Here is a brief rundown of my life so far. I did just enough in school to squeak by and graduate. I knew I was going to join the Army after Highschool instead of trying to go to college so doing well in school did not matter as much to me. For the first time around I was in the Army for about seven years. I did a lot of varied things but eventually decided it was time to see how the Civilian world was doing. I left the Army, moved back home to WA and eventually started working for Starbucks as a Helpdesk Analyst. I did that for another seven years and decided I really needed to add some technical certifications to my Resume so I could advance in the tech field. I contacted the VA to get some information about how to use the GI Bill and was contacted by a few people that knew about me from my first time in the Army and they wanted to know if I was interested in re-enlisting. I eventually let them talk me into it and re-enlisted and also started taking classes at a community college. Found out my Math skills were way under par so had to start at pretty much the beginning and after almost two years I was finally taking college level math classes. I had also taken English, Chemistry, Physics, and even a Photography class. The last one was a lot of fun, and one I would love to take again, but I started college to become a Computer Engineer and here I was almost two years into it and I hadn’t taken a single Computer related class. Then my unit was deployed to Iraq. While deployed I was involved in an incident that left me with a serious back injury. Took almost a year to recover from that. Tried to return to school but I also ended up getting married so that along with bills and my increasingly lack of interest in being a student I decided to return to the workforce. I began working for the VA at their Helpdesk. Worked at the VA for their helpdesk for three years and then was recruited away by my current employer, Blueprint Consulting Company. For the last two years I was working on an engagement providing support to Microsoft. After that engagement ended I was moved to my current engagement providing Technical Support to another company. I am here at Code Fellows to finally add a missing piece to my resume that is holding me back from the kind of career I really want to have.

  My wife continues to be extremely patient and supporting of me being a student at Codefellows. I told her that there probably will not be any time to go to dinners, watch movies or pretty much do anything else together and she fully understands. She knows this is something I have wanted for a long time now and she is ready to see where it will take us.

  One of the big things I wish to do once I am a former student is get back into SCUBA diving. I used to go on several trips a year, and go diving locally at least one weekend a month. I can’t wait to get back into the water. </p>
